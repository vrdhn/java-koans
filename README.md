```

Use any editor or IDE to edit the koans in `koans/*.java` files

To exit press ^C, or finish all the koans.


## philosphy

* Covers mostly language, going in libraries only when needed

* Part 1 -> Structure of method
* Part 2 -> Structure of class/interface/records etc.
* Part 3 -> Structure of project

# Features to add

* Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced tag, and to run only one subset.
* export all java docs to a text file for reviewing the content
* cmd line arg to run specific method.
